# Nowhere

This project is a web application for a town in nowhere. 
The web has a page to introduce people to the place, a page with the legends, some maps, photos and a contact section.
You can send your own legends or photography about this place. Or you can contribute with code too.
Is a open source project about a town that doesn't exist so anything is welcome.
